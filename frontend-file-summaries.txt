  "frontend/src/pages/CheckoutPage.tsx": "Multi-step checkout page; fixed both `handlePlaceOrder` and `handleGiftCardPlaceOrder` to include the required `approvalStatus: ApprovalStatus.pending` field when calling `placeOrder.mutateAsync`.",
  "frontend/src/pages/OrderConfirmationPage.tsx": "Order confirmation page with live approval status polling; fixed the `useGetOrderById` call to pass only one argument (removed the erroneous second `30_000` argument that doesn't exist in the hook signature).",
  "frontend/src/pages/AdminPanelPage.tsx": "Admin panel page wrapping `AdminPanelContent` in `AdminAccessControl`; `AdminPanelContent` renders the six-tab interface (Products, Orders, Payments, Admins, Subscriptions, Settings) immediately with no internal gates, relying solely on `AdminAccessControl` for access control.",

  "frontend/src/components/admin/CategoryManager.tsx": "Admin category management table with add/edit dialog and delete confirmation; delete now uses a `handleDelete` async function with try/catch to show success/error toasts via sonner, and the delete button is properly disabled while the mutation is pending.",
  "frontend/src/components/admin/CategoryForm.tsx": "Form component for creating and editing categories with name and description fields; now wraps `mutateAsync` in a try/catch to show a success toast and close the dialog on success, or an error toast (with the backend error message) on failure without closing the dialog.",

  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "Complete React Query hooks for all backend operations; adds `useVerifyAdminPin` mutation (calls `actor.verifyAdminPin`, unwraps Result variant, throws on `#err`) and `useAdminPinLockoutStatus` query (enabled only when actor and identity are available, `staleTime: 0`, `retry: 0`).",

  "frontend/src/hooks/useActor.ts": "Initializes the backend actor using React Query with the identity principal as cache key; removes the non-existent `_initializeAccessControlWithSecret` call (the root cause of the admin panel being stuck), adds exponential backoff retry (3 retries), invalidates dependent queries when the actor changes, and exports `isError`, `error`, and `refetch` in addition to `actor` and `isFetching`."
