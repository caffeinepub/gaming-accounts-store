{
  "frontend/src/pages/CheckoutPage.tsx": "Multi-step checkout page (Review → Contact → Payment Method → Payment Details) that collects buyer email/contact, passes all required fields (`buyerPrincipal`, `username`, `email`, `contactInfo`, `productId`, `paymentMethod`, `giftCardNumber`, `giftCardBalance`) to `usePlaceOrder`, uses the original payment component API (`amount`, `onConfirm`, `isLoading`), and navigates to confirmation with `0n` sentinel orderId on success.",
  "frontend/src/pages/OrderConfirmationPage.tsx": "Order confirmation page that shows a generic success screen for sentinel `orderId === 0n` or polls `getOrderById` every 10 seconds for real orders; fixed import to use `OrderApprovalStatus` instead of the non-existent `ApprovalStatus`.",
  "frontend/src/pages/AdminPanelPage.tsx": "Admin panel page wrapping `AdminPanelContent` in `AdminAccessControl`; `AdminPanelContent` renders the six-tab interface (Products, Orders, Payments, Admins, Subscriptions, Settings) immediately with no internal gates, relying solely on `AdminAccessControl` for access control.",
  "frontend/src/components/checkout/PaymentMethodSelector.tsx": "Radio-style payment method selector component with four options (PayPal, Crypto, UK Gift Card, Pay in 3) with icons and neon highlight on selection.",

  "frontend/src/components/checkout/CryptoPayment.tsx": "Cryptocurrency payment step that fetches real Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet addresses from the backend via `useStoreSettings`, displays each as a generated QR code image plus a copyable address with clipboard confirmation, and shows a \"Not configured\" message if an address is empty.",
  "frontend/src/components/checkout/GiftCardPayment.tsx": "UK Gift Card payment step with code validation, plus two required fields — Gift Card Number and Gift Card Balance — both of which must be filled before the confirm button is enabled; the `onConfirm` callback receives `(giftCardNumber, giftCardBalance)` as arguments with sunset theme styling throughout.",

  "frontend/src/components/admin/CategoryManager.tsx": "Admin category management table with add/edit dialog and delete confirmation; delete now uses a `handleDelete` async function with try/catch to show success/error toasts via sonner, and the delete button is properly disabled while the mutation is pending.",
  "frontend/src/components/admin/CategoryForm.tsx": "Form component for creating and editing categories with name and description fields; now wraps `mutateAsync` in a try/catch to show a success toast and close the dialog on success, or an error toast (with the backend error message) on failure without closing the dialog.",

  "frontend/src/components/admin/ProductForm.tsx": "Product create/edit form with fields for game name, title, description, account details, price, and availability; now explicitly passes `categoryId: product.categoryId ?? 0n` on update and `categoryId: 0n` on create to satisfy the updated `useUpdateProduct`/`useAddProduct` mutation signatures.",
  "frontend/index.html": "HTML entry point with `dark` class on `<html>`, inline critical CSS to set dark background/color before React hydrates, preventing any white flash on load.",

  "frontend/src/components/LoadingScreen3D.tsx": "Full-screen loading intro that replaces the Three.js/WebGL scene with a royalty-free NYC sunset MP4 video (from the provided assets) as the background, while fully preserving the 40-second countdown timer, the \"GAME VAULT\" red→purple→orange gradient clip-path progress reveal, and the \"Enter Store\" button that only appears after 40 seconds have elapsed.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "All React Query hooks for backend operations; `useStoreSettings` now accepts an `adminVerified` parameter and gates its query on it (matching `getStoreSettings`'s `enforceAdminSessionAccess` check on the backend), preventing unauthorized calls when the Settings tab is opened without a verified admin session.",

  "frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx": "Stub component kept for compatibility; App.tsx now handles layout directly without TanStack Router, so this file is a no-op.",
  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Tailwind configuration fixed to use `var(--token)` (plain CSS variable references) instead of `hsl(var(--token))` so all color utilities correctly resolve the OKLCH values defined in index.css.",
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Main app component with hash-based routing; fixes `useGetProductById` call to pass `productId ?? null` (resolving the `undefined` vs `null` type mismatch), keeps `CartItem` as `{product, quantity}` to match `CheckoutPage`, and uses `onContinueShopping` prop on `OrderConfirmationPage`.",
  "frontend/src/pages/StorefrontPage.tsx": "Storefront page with product grid and search — category filter UI (state, query, and button group) fully removed; all available products display by default.",
  "frontend/src/pages/SubscriptionsPage.tsx": "User-facing subscriptions page; fixes the `onSubscribe` prop signature to `(tier, billingCycle, price)` matching `App.tsx`'s `handleSubscribe` call; shows empty-state message when no tiers exist, billing toggle and tier cards when tiers are present.",

  "frontend/src/components/admin/StoreSettingsManager.tsx": "Admin store settings component that now reads `adminVerified` from `AdminSessionContext` and passes it to `useStoreSettings`, ensuring the settings query only fires after successful PIN verification — consistent with how `OrderManager` and `PaymentsManager` gate their queries.",
  "frontend/src/components/admin/PaymentsManager.tsx": "Admin payments and approvals table with approve/decline actions per order row; fixed import to use `OrderApprovalStatus` instead of the non-existent `ApprovalStatus`, and gates the orders query on `adminVerified` from context.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useActor.ts": "Initializes the backend actor using React Query with the identity principal as cache key; removes the non-existent `_initializeAccessControlWithSecret` call (the root cause of the admin panel product mutations failing with \"Unauthorized\"), adds exponential backoff retry (3 retries), invalidates dependent queries when the actor changes, and exports `isError`, `error`, and `refetch` in addition to `actor` and `isFetching`.",
  "frontend/src/contexts/AdminSessionContext.tsx": "New React context that tracks whether the admin PIN has been successfully verified; provides `adminVerified` boolean and `setAdminVerified` setter via `useAdminSession` hook, wrapped in `AdminSessionProvider`."
