{
  "frontend/src/pages/CheckoutPage.tsx": "Multi-step checkout page with a dedicated `handleGiftCardPlaceOrder` callback that captures gift card number and balance and passes them to `usePlaceOrder`; all other payment methods use `handlePlaceOrder` which passes empty strings for gift card fields.",
  "frontend/src/pages/OrderConfirmationPage.tsx": "Order confirmation page with live approval status section (refetching every 30 seconds), colour-coded approval badge, gift card details display, and next-steps guidance — fixed the conflicting `font-rajdhani`/`font-mono` classnames on the gift card number span and updated `flex-shrink-0` to `shrink-0`.",
  "frontend/src/pages/AdminPanelPage.tsx": "Admin panel page with six tabs (Products, Orders, Payments, Admins, Subscriptions, Settings) — the new Payments tab renders the `PaymentsManager` component; default active tab remains Products.",

  "frontend/src/components/checkout/PayPalPayment.tsx": "Mock PayPal payment step with branding, simulated redirect flow, and confirmation before order placement.",
  "frontend/src/components/checkout/CryptoPayment.tsx": "Cryptocurrency payment step that fetches real Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet addresses from the backend via `useStoreSettings`, displays each as a generated QR code image plus a copyable address with clipboard confirmation, and shows a \"Not configured\" message if an address is empty.",
  "frontend/src/components/checkout/GiftCardPayment.tsx": "UK Gift Card payment step with code validation, plus two required fields — Gift Card Number and Gift Card Balance — both of which must be filled before the confirm button is enabled; the `onConfirm` callback receives `(giftCardNumber, giftCardBalance)` as arguments with sunset theme styling throughout.",
  "frontend/src/components/checkout/PayIn3Payment.tsx": "Pay in 3 installments BNPL step showing installment schedule with due dates, agreement checkbox, and order placement.",
  "frontend/src/components/admin/CategoryManager.tsx": "Admin category management table with add/edit dialog and delete confirmation; delete now uses a `handleDelete` async function with try/catch to show success/error toasts via sonner, and the delete button is properly disabled while the mutation is pending.",
  "frontend/src/components/admin/CategoryForm.tsx": "Form component for creating and editing categories with name and description fields; now wraps `mutateAsync` in a try/catch to show a success toast and close the dialog on success, or an error toast (with the backend error message) on failure without closing the dialog.",
  "frontend/src/components/admin/ProductManager.tsx": "Admin product management table showing all products with edit/delete actions, wired to backend mutations with category name resolution.",
  "frontend/src/components/admin/ProductForm.tsx": "Product create/edit form with fields for game name, title, description, account details, price, and availability toggle — now uses `mutate` with inline `onSuccess`/`onError` callbacks instead of `mutateAsync`, showing success/error toasts via sonner and calling `onSuccess()` only after a confirmed successful backend response.",

  "frontend/src/components/LoadingScreen3D.tsx": "Full-screen loading intro that replaces the Three.js/WebGL scene with a royalty-free NYC sunset MP4 video (from the provided assets) as the background, while fully preserving the 40-second countdown timer, the \"GAME VAULT\" red→purple→orange gradient clip-path progress reveal, and the \"Enter Store\" button that only appears after 40 seconds have elapsed.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "React Query hooks for all backend operations; fixed `useGetUsernameByPrincipal` and `useIsAdminUsername` to use `isFetched = !actorFetching && isEnabled && query.isFetched` (instead of `isEnabled ? query.isFetched : false`) so the fetched flag correctly transitions to `true` once the actor is ready and the query resolves, preventing the admin gate from getting stuck in a permanent loading state.",
  "frontend/src/components/ProfileSetupModal.tsx": "Username creation modal that blocks all store access for authenticated users without a username; enforces no-spaces rule, debounced uniqueness checking with inline feedback, and cannot be dismissed until a valid username is submitted.",
  "frontend/src/components/AdminAccessControl.tsx": "Admin gate component with a username-entry form that uses proper HTML form semantics (`<form onSubmit>` + `type=\"submit\"` button) so both Enter key and button clicks trigger submission; separates network/backend errors (shown inline with an AlertCircle icon beneath the input, clearing as the user types) from access-denied responses (shown on a dedicated denied screen), with a loading spinner while the `isAdminUsername` call is in-flight and a Try Again button that resets back to the entry form.",
  "frontend/src/components/admin/AdminWhitelistManager.tsx": "Admin panel component for managing the admin username whitelist with add/remove functionality, local cache management, and confirmation dialogs for removals. Fixed imports to use the correct hook names `useAddAdminUser` and `useRemoveAdminUser` from useQueries.",

  "frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx": "Stub component kept for compatibility; App.tsx now handles layout directly without TanStack Router, so this file is a no-op.",
  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Tailwind configuration fixed to use `var(--token)` (plain CSS variable references) instead of `hsl(var(--token))` so all color utilities correctly resolve the OKLCH values defined in index.css.",
