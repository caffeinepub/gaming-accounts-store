      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Pressing Enter in the username input field triggers form submission without requiring a mouse click on the button",
        "Clicking the Submit button also triggers form submission",
        "A loading spinner or disabled state is visible on the button while the `isAdminUsername` backend call is in-flight",
        "If the backend returns `true`, the admin panel content (children) is rendered immediately",
        "If the backend returns `false`, the AccessDeniedScreen is rendered with an access-denied message",
        "If the backend call throws an error, an inline error message is displayed beneath the input field — no silent failure",
        "The form never silently does nothing; every submission path has visible feedback",
        "The retry option on AccessDeniedScreen resets the component back to the username entry form"

          "description": "Rewrite the form submission handler to use proper HTML form semantics: (1) Change the root element from a div with onClick to a <form> element with an onSubmit handler that calls event.preventDefault(); (2) Set the Submit button type to 'submit' so both Enter key in the input and button clicks invoke the same handler; (3) Add local loading state (useState) that is set to true when the backend call starts and false when it resolves or rejects; (4) Disable the input and button while loading is true; (5) Add a loading spinner or 'Verifying...' text on the button during the in-flight state; (6) Wrap the backend isAdminUsername call in a try/catch block; (7) On successful response of true, transition local status to 'granted' and render children; (8) On successful response of false, transition local status to 'denied' and render AccessDeniedScreen; (9) On caught error, display an inline error message beneath the input field using a <p> element with sunset-themed error styling (e.g., text-sunset-orange or text-red-400); (10) Ensure the AccessDeniedScreen retry/back option resets the local status state back to the initial form state so the user can re-enter their username; (11) Preserve all existing sunset theme styling (dusk-bg/dusk-mid backgrounds, sunset-gold/sunset-orange accents, Orbitron/Rajdhani fonts, sunset glow effects) on the form, input, button, and error message. Verify the component's usage instructions before implementing."
