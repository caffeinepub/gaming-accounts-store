  "summary": "Both REQ-7 and REQ-8 appear to be fully implemented in the diff. REQ-7 is satisfied by removing the logo/icon from Navigation.tsx (only the brand-gradient-text span remains, no image/SVG/icon). REQ-8 is satisfied by defining a .brand-gradient-text CSS utility in index.css using a red→purple→orange linear-gradient with background-clip text technique, and applying it in Navigation.tsx, Footer.tsx, and LoadingScreen3D.tsx. No missing requirements or hallucinated features are detected.",
