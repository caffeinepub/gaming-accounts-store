  "summary": "The diff modifies frontend/src/components/AdminAccessControl.tsx to implement a manual username-entry screen as required by REQ-94. The implementation replaces the auto-resolved gate logic with a form-based flow, calls isAdminUsername on submit, handles granted/denied/loading states, and applies sunset theme styling. Most acceptance criteria appear to be met. The AccessDeniedScreen component referenced in the spec is not used — instead, an inline denied UI is rendered. The form label reads 'Username' rather than 'Enter your username'. No React Query hooks or getUsername calls are present in the new implementation.",

      "requirement": "If isAdminUsername returns false, render the AccessDeniedScreen component with an access-denied message.",
      "reason": "The diff implements an inline denied UI instead of using the AccessDeniedScreen component. The acceptance criteria explicitly states the AccessDeniedScreen component is rendered with an access-denied message, but the code does not import or render AccessDeniedScreen.",
