  "summary": "The diff modifies frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json. The summary for AdminPanelPage.tsx confirms REQ-103 is implemented (no internal async gates, defaults to Products tab). However, there is no evidence of changes to AdminAccessControl.tsx or useActor.ts, which are required by REQ-102 and REQ-104 respectively. The diff only shows modifications to two metadata/summary files, not the actual component source files.",
