  "requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-95",
      "text": "Rewrite the form submission handler in `frontend/src/components/AdminAccessControl.tsx` so that: (1) the root element is a `<form>` with an `onSubmit` handler (not an `onClick` only), so pressing Enter in the username input natively triggers submission; (2) the Submit button has `type=\"submit\"` so both Enter key and button click invoke the same handler; (3) the `onSubmit` handler calls `event.preventDefault()` to prevent page reload, then calls the backend `isAdminUsername` function with the exact string the user typed; (4) a local loading/spinner state is set to true while the call is in-flight and reset to false when it resolves; (5) if the backend returns `true`, local status transitions to `'granted'` and the children are rendered; (6) if the backend returns `false`, local status transitions to `'denied'` and `AccessDeniedScreen` is rendered; (7) any thrown error from the backend call is caught in a try/catch and displayed as an inline error message beneath the input field rather than being swallowed silently; (8) the retry/back option on `AccessDeniedScreen` resets local status back to the initial form state so the user can try again. The sunset theme (dusk-bg/dusk-mid backgrounds, sunset-gold/sunset-orange accent colours, Orbitron/Rajdhani fonts, sunset glow effects) must be preserved on the form.",

      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Pressing Enter in the username input field triggers form submission without requiring a mouse click on the button",
        "Clicking the Submit button also triggers form submission",
        "A loading spinner or disabled state is visible on the button while the `isAdminUsername` backend call is in-flight",
        "If the backend returns `true`, the admin panel content (children) is rendered immediately",
        "If the backend returns `false`, the AccessDeniedScreen is rendered with an access-denied message",
        "If the backend call throws an error, an inline error message is displayed beneath the input field — no silent failure",
        "The form never silently does nothing; every submission path has visible feedback",
        "The retry option on AccessDeniedScreen resets the component back to the username entry form"

  "constraints": [
    "Do not alter any other component, page, or hook — this fix is scoped exclusively to `frontend/src/components/AdminAccessControl.tsx`",
    "The username typed by the user must remain the sole input passed to `isAdminUsername` — do not auto-fetch or inject the authenticated user's stored username",
    "Preserve the existing sunset theme styling on the form (dusk-bg/dusk-mid backgrounds, sunset-gold/sunset-orange accents, Orbitron/Rajdhani fonts)"
