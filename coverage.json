        "summary": "Rewrite `frontend/src/components/AdminAccessControl.tsx` with a fully self-contained manual username-entry gate that does NOT depend on Internet Identity authentication state or any React Query hooks for its control flow. The component must: (1) use a local `status` state variable with values `'connecting' | 'form' | 'checking' | 'granted' | 'denied' | 'timeout'`; (2) on mount, wait for the actor to become available by polling `actor` from `useActor` — if the actor is ready, immediately transition to `status = 'form'`; if the actor is not ready after 10 seconds, transition to `status = 'timeout'` and display 'Unable to connect to the server. Please refresh the page and try again.' — do NOT spin indefinitely; (3) when `status === 'form'`, render a styled `<form>` with a heading 'Admin Access', a text input labelled 'Enter your username', and a `type=\"submit\"` button — both Enter key and button click must trigger submission; (4) the `onSubmit` handler must call `event.preventDefault()`, set `status = 'checking'`, then call the backend `isAdminUsername` function with the exact typed string; (5) if the backend returns `true`, set `status = 'granted'` and render `{children}`; (6) if the backend returns `false`, set `status = 'denied'` and render `AccessDeniedScreen`; (7) catch any thrown error from the `isAdminUsername` call and display it as an inline error message below the input — never swallow errors silently; (8) the retry/back option on `AccessDeniedScreen` must reset `status` back to `'form'`; (9) apply the sunset theme (dusk-bg/dusk-mid backgrounds, sunset-gold/sunset-orange accent colours, Orbitron/Rajdhani fonts, sunset glow effects) to all rendered states.",

Verify the agent host is set to `https://ic0.app` (not a local replica URL) when running in production, and that the canister ID is resolved from the correct environment variable or hardcoded DFX-generated value. The actor must be created and exposed synchronously where possible so that components waiting on the actor do not stall. Ensure the hook re-creates the actor correctly on login/logout and surfaces initialisation errors to consumers rather than failing silently.",
