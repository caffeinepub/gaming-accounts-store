  "summary": "A Shopify-style gaming accounts e-commerce store called Game Vault with a 3D Three.js loading screen (sports cars, motorcycles, realistic cars driving into a New York sunset). Store sells gaming accounts starting with Car Parking Multiplayer. Features full admin panel, user authentication via Internet Identity, and checkout flows for PayPal, Crypto, UK Gift Cards, and Pay in 3 Installments. The storefront logo has been removed and the 'Game Vault' site name displays a red → purple → orange 3-tone gradient across navbar, footer, loading screen, and all instances. Users must create a unique username (no spaces) on first login before accessing the store; username is used for purchases (order confirmations show username, email, contact info, and product purchased) and for admin panel access control. Admin Panel link is visible to all users in the navbar but only whitelisted usernames can enter. Store owner manages the admin whitelist in the backend. The username 'Frosty' is hardcoded as the initial seed admin in the backend whitelist. The overall website theme has been changed to a sunset aesthetic — replacing the dark neon theme entirely with warm golden-oranges, deep purples, dusky pinks, and soft golden yellows aligned with the 3D loading screen's NYC sunset scene. The 'Game Vault' gradient text (red → purple → orange) remains unchanged.",
