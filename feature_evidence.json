Since tiers are now auto-seeded in the backend, the component must simply fetch and display the existing tiers via `useSubscriptionTiers()`. If the tiers query returns an empty array (which should no longer happen), display a neutral empty state without an initialization button.",

Audit `backend/main.mo` to verify the `placeOrder` function correctly persists new orders to stable storage and that `getOrders()` (used by the admin panel) retrieves all stored orders. Audit `frontend/src/pages/CheckoutPage.tsx` and `frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts` to ensure the `placeOrder` mutation is correctly called with all required fields, the actor call is properly awaited, and the `#ok`/`#err` result is unwrapped. Fix any issue found — whether it is a missing field in the payload, a type mismatch, a silent failure in the mutation, or a backend storage/retrieval bug — so that after a user completes checkout, the resulting order is immediately visible in the admin Orders and Payments tabs.",
