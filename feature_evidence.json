      "featureTitle": "Rewrite `frontend/src/components/AdminAccessControl.tsx` to replace all previous auto-resolved gate logic with a manual username-entry screen. When any user navigates to the admin panel, the component must immediately render a styled form containing: a heading (e.g. 'Admin Access'), a text input labelled 'Enter your username', and a 'Submit' button. On submit, call the backend `isAdminUsername` function with the exact string the user typed. If the backend returns `true`, transition to 'access granted' and render the children. If the backend returns `false`, render the `AccessDeniedScreen` with an access-denied message. Do NOT silently fetch the authenticated user's stored username, do NOT call `getUsername` or any React Query hook as part of the gate decision, and do NOT auto-resolve access based on Internet Identity authentication state. The username the user types is the only input used for the whitelist check. Show a loading/spinner state only while the `isAdminUsername` backend call is in-flight. Apply the sunset theme (dusk-bg/dusk-mid backgrounds, sunset-gold/sunset-orange accent colours, Orbitron/Rajdhani fonts, sunset glow effects) to the username-entry form.",
